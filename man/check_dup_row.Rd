\arguments{
\item{path}{Filepath for the summary statistics file to be formatted. A
dataframe or datatable of the summary statistics file can also be passed
directly to MungeSumstats using the path parameter.}

filtered out SNPs (separate file per filter). The data is outputted in the
same format specified for the resulting sumstats file. The only exception to
this rule is if output is vcf, then log file saved as .tsv.gz. Default is
FALSE.}

\item{tabix_index}{Index the formatted summary statistics with
\href{http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html}{tabix} for fast querying.}
