}
\arguments{
\item{sumstats_dt}{data table obj of the summary statistics file for the GWAS.}

\item{path}{Filepath for the summary statistics file to be formatted.}

\item{ref_genome}{name of the reference genome used for
the GWAS ("GRCh37" or "GRCh38").}

\item{rsids}{\code{data.table} of snpsById, filtered to SNPs of
interest if loaded already. Or else NULL.}

\item{allele_flip_check}{Binary Should the allele columns be checked against
reference genome to infer if flipping is necessary. Default is TRUE.}

\item{allele_flip_drop}{Binary Should the SNPs for which neither their A1 or
A2 base pair values match a reference genome be dropped. Default is TRUE.}

\item{keepEA}{Add a column "EA" to record which allele was the effect allele
in the original summary statistics.}

\item{standardise_headers}{Run \code{standardise_sumstats_column_headers_crossplatform} first.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data tables:
\itemize{
\item \code{sumstats_dt}: the modified summary statistics \code{data.table} object.
\item \code{rsids}: snpsById, filtered to SNPs of interest if loaded already. Or else NULL.
