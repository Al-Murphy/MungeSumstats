Description: 
  The *MungeSumstats* package is designed to facilitate the standardisation of 
  GWAS summary statistics. It reformats inputted summary statisitics to include 
  SNP, CHR, BP and can look up these values if any are missing. It also pefrorms 
  dozens of QC and filtering steps to ensure high data quality and
  minimise inter-study differences.
