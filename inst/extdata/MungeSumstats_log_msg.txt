Summary statistics report:
   - 93 rows
   - 93 unique variants
   - 64 genome-wide significant variants (P<5e-8)
   - 20 chromosomes
Checking for multi-GWAS.
Checking for multiple RSIDs on one row.
Checking SNP RSIDs.
Checking for merged allele column.
Ensuring all SNPs are on the reference genome.
Loading reference genome data.
Checking for correct direction of A1 (reference) and A2 (alternative allele).
There are 46 SNPs where A1 doesn't match the reference genome.
These will be flipped with their effect columns.
Checking for missing data.
Checking for duplicate columns.
6 p-values are >1 which LDSC/MAGMA may not be able to handle. These will be converted to 1.
3 p-values are <0 which LDSC/MAGMA may not be able to handle. These will be converted to 0.
Checking for duplicate SNPs from SNP ID.
Checking for SNPs with duplicated base-pair positions.
Filtering SNPs, ensuring SE>0.
Ensuring all SNPs have N<5 std dev above mean.
Removing 'chr' prefix from CHR.
Making X/Y CHR uppercase.
Checking for bi-allelic SNPs.
Warning: When method is an integer, must be >0.
67 SNPs (72%) have FRQ values > 0.5. Conventionally the FRQ column is intended to show the minor/effect allele frequency.
The FRQ column was mapped from one of the following from the inputted  summary statistics file:
FRQ, EAF, MAF, FRQ_U, F_U, FREQUENCY, FREQ, FREQ_TESTED_ALLELE, FRQ_TESTED_ALLELE, FREQ_EFFECT_ALLELE, FRQ_EFFECT_ALLELE, EFFECT_ALLELE_FREQUENCY, EFFECT_ALLELE_FREQ, EFFECT_ALLELE_FRQ, A1FREQ, A1FRQ, A2FREQ, A2FRQ, ALLELE_FREQUENCY, ALLELE_FREQ, ALLELE_FRQ, AF, MINOR_AF, EFFECT_AF, A2_AF, EFF_AF, ALT_AF, ALTERNATIVE_AF, INC_AF, A_2_AF, TESTED_AF
As frq_is_maf=TRUE, the FRQ column will not be renamed. If the FRQ values were intended to represent major allele frequency,
set frq_is_maf=FALSE to rename the column as MAJOR_ALLELE_FRQ and differentiate it from minor/effect allele frequency.
Sorting coordinates.
