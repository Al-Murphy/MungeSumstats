# Introduction

The *hssGWAS* package is designed to facilitate the standardisation of GWAS summary statistics as utilised in our Nature Genetics paper [@Skene2018].

# Overview

The package is designed to handle the lack of standardisation of output files by the GWAS community. There is a group who have now manually standardised many GWAS: [R interface to the IEU GWAS database API â€¢ ieugwasr](https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/) and [gwasvcf](https://github.com/MRCIEU/gwasvcf) but because a lot of GWAS remain closed access, these repositories are not all encompassing. 

*hssGWAS* provides a framework standardise the format fo any GWAS summary statistics enabling downstream integration and analysis. The package works by addressing the most common discrepancies across summary statistics.

# Installing hssGWAS

The *hssGWAS* package is available from github. To be able to install the package one needs to run the following lines of code:

```
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("neurogenomics/hssGWAS")
```

You can then load the package and data package:

```{r }
library(hssGWAS)
```


# Getting started

See the vignette for use cases of *hssGWAS*.

If you have any problems please do file an issue here on github.
